                <p>
                    Any Latvian will tell you that we’ve forged a very special relationship with nature – we pick, hunt, forage, smoke, cure, pickle and ferment everything we can get our hands on. With four distinct seasons, it’s seasonality that dictates what’s on our plates. Spring brings mountains of baby vegetables, almost nothing but freshly-picked berries are eaten in summer and apple harvest in autumn marks the start of winter food prep. Once a thick layer of snow covers the ground and temperatures fall to -20°C, we raid our pantries and dig into jars of pickled veg, chutneys and jams. Latvian food is all about comforting, soul-soothing and caring home cooking with every bite resembling a warm hug. <a href="https://www.lovefood.com/guides/77095/a-locals-guide-to-food-and-drink-in-latvia">more information...</a>

        <h2>LIDO</h2>
            <p>Introduce your guests to truly Latvian flavours! You will be welcomed by lovely hosts in national costume and served Latvian national cuisine – food and drink made according to traditional recipes passed on from generation to generation. LIDO was founded in 1987, and is still owned by the founder of the company Gunārs Ķirsons. LIDO is one of the first private enterprises in Latvia since the restoration of independence, and its network of restaurants and bistros has become an integral part of the image of Latvia. In 1999, with the opening of bistro Vērmanītis after reconstruction at 65 Elizabetes Street the new LIDO concept was implemented – bringing a restaurant atmosphere to the bistro, yet maintaining a democratic choice of dishes on a different price level.
