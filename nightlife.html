                <h2>Nightlife</h2>
                <p>
                    Surprise and wonder line since the first minute. The city is elegant, hospitable and intriguing for both the atmosphere and the architecture, the entertainment and nightlife: Latvia's capital boasts the presence of many restaurants, wine bars, pubs and discos to envy major European capitals. Most of the pubs and clubs are located in the historical centre of Riga and are crowded from Wednesday to Saturday. The old town of Riga is pretty small and it's easy to visit 4 or 5 pubs or clubs every night. There are also real Pub tours organized to run pubs in the city and to get plastered in company! The local youths did not spend all night in one club, but love to move and enjoy the different styles that each Riga bar has to offer. <a href="http://www.nightlife-cityguide.com/en/guide-nightlife/riga-nightlife-nightlife-local-nightclubs/">more information...</a>

        <h2>Coyote Fly</h2>
            <p>Nowhere else will you find a barwoman who can mix the best cocktail and mess with one’s head, a deejay able not only to move the floor but also to raise the roof, and an atmosphere turning every day into a party. This is appreciated by both the most rigorous nightlife enjoyers in Riga and such celebrities as Xzibit, Eve, Dizzee Rascal, Tony Hawks, Jon Olsson, The Dudesons and many others. Even the interior of Coyote Fly is entirely special. It combines the pristine breath of Vērmanes Garden with modernity, while corresponding to the layout and acoustics of a concert hall, which gives our visitors a chance to enjoy not only a wonderful leisure time in a genial company but also an excellent sound, lights and senses. You should come, too! People have been talking about the special atmosphere of Vērmanes Garden for a long time. However, the things they are talking about today and will talk about in the future are happening now at Coyote Fly.</p>

        <h2>Just Bar</h2>
            <p>Just Bar is one of the mainstream bars and clubs in the Old Town. Its proximity to hostels, as well as a free entrance and half-price drinks until 24.00 brings many people down there. During the working days “Just Bar” looks more of a bar/restaurant serving food and drinks at quite reasonable prices.</p>
