                <h2>Welcome to Riga</h2>
                <p>
                    Latvia is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe. Riga, Latvia’s capital, is set on the Baltic Sea at the mouth of the River Daugava. It's considered a cultural center and is home to many museums and concert halls. The city is also known for its wooden buildings, art nouveau architecture and medieval Old Town. The pedestrian-only Old Town has many shops and restaurants and is home to busy Livu Square, with bars and nightclubs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riga">more information...</a>

                <h2>Riga - The Birthplace of Christmas Tree</h2>

                <p>It all began more than 500 years ago. One of legends says that the first Christmas tree was put up by medieval Brotherhood of Blackheads, the guild uniting Riga’s merchants and craftsmen, and decorated in Riga, capital city of Latvia, in 1510. It was decorated with anything that came to hand – nuts, apples, dried berries, flowers, ribbons, toys handmade ornaments and then nicely displayed at the central market square (today Riga Town Hall Square) nearby the Blackheads’ House. Meanwhile, another story reveals that the tree was decorated with paper flowers and set on fire by the Blackheads at the end of the holiday season; most probably, as it was believed to bring good luck. <a href="http://www.koreapost.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=10538">more information...</a>
